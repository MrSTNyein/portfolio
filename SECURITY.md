# Security Policy

I take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in my portfolio website, I encourage you to report it to me privately.

## Supported Versions

Since this is a personal portfolio deployed as a static site, only the most recent version deployed on Vercel is considered supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send a private email to:

**sithunyein.mailto@gmail.com**

Please include a detailed description of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and steps to reproduce it if possible. I will do my best to respond to your report as quickly as possible.

### What to Expect

If you report a vulnerability, I will:

- Acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- Investigate the issue and provide a more detailed response.
- Credit you for your discovery after the vulnerability has been addressed, if you wish.

Thank you for helping to keep my project secure.
